#  Dynamic IPL Batsman Performance Predictor

A machine learning app that predicts a batsman's **Performance Index (BPI)** using IPL statistics.

##  Project Overview
This project uses IPL player performance data to build predictive models that estimate a batsman's effectiveness (BPI).  
Built with **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**.

##  Key Features
- Dynamic player & season selection
- Auto-fetches player stats from dataset
- Predicts BPI using trained ML models
- Visualizes Actual vs Predicted performance
- Displays model metrics (R², RMSE, MAE)
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard

##  Models Used
- Decsision Tree 
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  

##  Technologies
- Python   
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Plotly, Streamlit  
- GitHub for version control
